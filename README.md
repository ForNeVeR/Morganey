# Morganey [![Status Umbra](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-umbra-red.svg)](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/andivionian-status-classifier)

It's the [Lambda Calculus][wiki-lambda-calculus] Interpreter and it
interprets lambda terms! \o/

## Usage ##

Before doing anything useful with Morganey you need to install
[sbt][scala-sbt] first.

### REPL ###

To run the REPL just enter

    $ sbt run

in the source code directory and start typing lambda terms there. The
syntax of the lambda terms is

    <term> ::= <variable> | <function> | <application>
    <variable> ::= [a-z]+
    <function> ::= ( <lambda-symbol> . <variable> <term> )
    <application> ::= ( <term> <term> )
    <lambda-symbol> ::= Î» | \

The REPL will take the entered lambda term, beta-reduce it with the
normal order reduction strategy and output the normal form of the
entered lambda term.

**WARNING!** If the term is not reduciable to a beta normal form (for
example `(\x . (x x)) (\x . (x x))`) the REPL will crash with the
stack overflow exception.

To quit the REPL just `^C` it.

### Unit Tests ###

To run the Unit Tests enter

    $ sbt clean coverage test

in the source code directory.

And after that you can take a look at the Unit Test coverage
results. Just open `target/scala-2.11/scoverage-report/index.html`
with your favorite browser.

Enjoy!
