# Lambda Calculus Interpreter # [![Status Umbra](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-umbra-red.svg)](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/andivionian-status-classifier)

It's the [Lambda Calculus][wiki-lambda-calculus] Interpreter and it
interprets lambda terms! \o/

## Usage ##

It's unusable yet. But we are working on this. Right now you can run
some unit tests. To do that you need to install [sbt][scala-sbt]
first. And after that you can simply

    $ sbt clean coverage test

in the source code directory.

And after that you can take a look at the Unit Test coverage
results. Just open `target/scala-2.11/scoverage-report/index.html`
with your favorite browser.

Enjoy!
