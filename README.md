# Lambda Calculus Interpreter #

It's the [Lambda Calculus][wiki-lambda-calculus] Interpreter and it
interprets lambda terms! \o/

## Usage ##

It's unusable yet. But we are working on this. Right now you can run
some unit tests. To do that you need to install [sbt][scala-sbt]
first. And after that you can simply

    $ sbt test

in the source code directory.

Enjoy!
